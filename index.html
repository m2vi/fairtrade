        The very beginning of the fair trade movement was in the 1960s. It wasn’t until the 1990s that a Fairtrade Mark was created and a series of required ‘standards’ were set out. Fairtrade wanted to improve the conditions under which the workers have to work, community facilities and a fair pay for certain farmers and workers.
        <br><br>
        The Fairtrade ‘standards’ are a detailed list of things that need to be achieved before products can be classified as Fairtrade goods. They include things like fair pay. The aim of having these standards is to ensure that costs are covered and that there is a bit of money as well to invest in local community projects. The Fairtrade standards also exist to make sure that the conditions people work under are acceptable and fair.
        <br><br>
        The first product to be classified as Fairtrade was Maya Gold chocolate in 1994. Since then there have been many more things added to the Fairtrade Mark, including coffee, tea, chocolate, sugar, honey, fruits (for example, bananas, mangoes, pineapples), flowers, gold, silver and cotton.
        <br><br>
        Some people have argued that Fairtrade has a negative effect on what is called the ‘free market’, where products are produced when they are needed and farms can grow different crops as well as use new mechanical equipment, if the demand for their product increases. Fairtrade doesn’t always help encourage this.

          In the world there are a lot of machines which produce exhaust gases and the number will double in the next year.
          In some parts of the world there is a lot of smoke. Especially in big towns. That is not good for trees, plant and seeds. It is also bad for rivers and lakes.
          When you work on the field you produce exhaust gases or when you drive in your holidays or to work with the car you produce more exhaust gases as if you drive with public transportation like the underground or tram.
          So what can we do? We can drive more with the bike or with public transportation. Since 2016 there is a new liquid called adblue. Whit this liquid you can clean fuel. Another possibility is to integrate a cleaner for the exhaust gases.

          We humans need so much food that we have mass production and in mass production the animals are in small cages which have 20 or more animals in it and the people don't stop they make even more mass production and more and more and more!
          But that is not the only problem there are also crucial games like Rodeo or Bullfight( The Bullfight is already forbidden) there are even more.
          So what can we do? It is ok to eat meat but we shouldn't eat to much. And also stop playing and watching these supid games like rodeo.

          Racism is the belief in the natural superiority of one race over another. It may mean prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity.
          Racism can also be used to describe the social, legal, cultural, economic, and political processes that are a result of those beliefs.
          During the Holocaust, Nazis in Germany believed that some races did not even deserve to exist. These beliefs were racist. Because of those beliefs, they killed many people who belonged to those races. Those actions, which resulted from their racist beliefs, were also racist.
          Racism has existed throughout human history. It has caused wars, slavery, the creation of nations, and laws. However, racism has never been the only cause of wars and slavery. Leaders often used racism to make their actions seem all right. For example, the Nazis used the idea that Slavic peoples were less than human to make it seem all right to take over those people's countries or the idea of African Americans were less than them.
